# Automating Modern Code Review Processes with Code Similarity Measurement

This repository contains research code for the paper ["Automating Modern Code Review Processes with Code Similarity Measurement"](http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4450324). Our research aims to automating code review processes by measuring code similarity.

Data and models available at [Mega.nz](https://mega.nz/folder/kv4GDDJa#pcgag7752nVLPumSilU_yg).

## Auxiliary Libraries

In `libs` directory, you can find auxiliary libraries that we used in our experiments.

1. **Vectorizers:** TF-IDF, Bag-of-Words, Word2Vec, Doc2Vec, Transformers
2. **Metrics:** Text similarity, vector distance.

## Evaluation

`experiment.py` contains necessary codes to reproduce the experiments in the paper.
You can find example usage in `experiment_runner.ipynb`.
